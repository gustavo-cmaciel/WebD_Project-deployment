                </div>
                <p> Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Heart diseases include:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: -10px;">
                    <li>Blood vessel disease, such as coronary artery disease</li>
                    <li>Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)</li>
                    <li>Heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects)</li>
                    <li>Heart valve disease</li>
                    <li>Disease of the heart muscle</li>
                    <li>Heart infection</li>

                </ul>
                <p> Many forms of heart disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.</p>
                <div class="hSymptoms">
                    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                </div>
                <p> Symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other signs and symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.
                    <br/>Signs and symptoms can include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
                    <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>

                    <h4>Control your portion size</h4>

                <div class="cyps">
                    <p>
                        How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Overloading your plate, taking seconds and eating until you feel stuffed can lead to eating more calories than you should. Portions served in restaurants are often more than anyone needs. Following
                        a few simple tips to control food portion size can help you shape up your diet as well as your heart and waistline: Use a small plate or bowl to help control your portions. Eat more low-calorie, nutrient-rich foods, such as fruits
                        and vegetables Eat smaller amounts of high-calorie, high-sodium foods, such as refined, processed or fast foods. It's also important to keep track of the number of servings you eat. Some things to keep in mind: A serving size is
                        a specific amount of food, defined by common measurements such as cups, ounces or pieces. For example, one serving of pasta is about 1/3 to 1/2 cup, or about the size of a hockey puck. A serving of meat, fish or chicken is about
                        2 to 3 ounces, or about the size and thickness of a deck of cards. The recommended number of servings per food group may vary depending on the specific diet or guidelines you're following. Judging serving size is a learned skill.
                        You may need to use measuring cups and spoons or a scale until you're comfortable with your judgment.

                    <h4>Eat more vegetables and fruits</h4>

                    <p>Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals. Vegetables and fruits are also low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Vegetables and fruits, like other plants or plant-based foods, contain substances that may help
                        prevent cardiovascular disease. Eating more fruits and vegetables may help you cut back on higher calorie foods, such as meat, cheese and snack foods. Featuring vegetables and fruits in your diet can be easy. Keep vegetables washed
                        and cut in your refrigerator for quick snacks. Keep fruit in a bowl in your kitchen so that you'll remember to eat it. Choose recipes that have vegetables or fruits as the main ingredients, such as vegetable stir-fry or fresh fruit
                        mixed into salads.</p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4>Select whole grains</h4>
                    </div>

                    <p> Whole grains are good sources of fiber and other nutrients that play a role in regulating blood pressure and heart health. You can increase the amount of whole grains in a heart-healthy diet by making simple substitutions for refined
                        grain products. Or be adventuresome and try a new whole grain, such as whole-grain farro, quinoa or barley.</p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4>Limit unhealthy fats</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p> Limiting how much saturated and trans fats you eat is an important step to reduce your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of coronary artery disease. A high blood cholesterol level can lead to a buildup of plaques in your arteries,
                        called atherosclerosis, which can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.</p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4>Choose low-fat protein sources </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p>Lean meat, poultry and fish, low-fat dairy products, and eggs are some of your best sources of protein. Choose lower fat options, such as skinless chicken breasts rather than fried chicken patties and skim milk rather than whole milk.
                        Fish is a good alternative to high-fat meats. Certain types of fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can lower blood fats called triglycerides. You'll find the highest amounts of omega-3 fatty acids in cold-water fish, such
                        as salmon, mackerel and herring. Other sources are flaxseed, walnuts, soybeans and canola oil. Legumes — beans, peas and lentils — also are good, low-fat sources of protein and contain no cholesterol, making them good substitutes
                        for meat. Substituting plant protein for animal protein — for example, a soy or bean burger for a hamburger — will reduce your fat and cholesterol intake and increase your fiber intake. </p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4>Reduce the salt (sodium) in your food </h4>
                    </div>
                    <p> Eating too much salt can lead to high blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease. Limiting salt (sodium) is an important part of a heart-healthy diet. The American Heart Association recommends that: Healthy adults have no more
                        than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day (about a teaspoon of salt) Most adults ideally have no more than 1,500 mg of sodium a day Although reducing the amount of salt you add to food at the table or while cooking is a good first
                        step, much of the salt you eat comes from canned or processed foods, such as soups, baked goods and frozen dinners. Eating fresh foods and making your own soups and stews can reduce the amount of salt you eat. If you like the convenience
                        of canned soups and prepared meals, look for ones with no added salt or reduced sodium. Be wary of foods that claim to be lower in sodium because they are seasoned with sea salt instead of regular table salt — sea salt has the
                        same nutritional value as regular salt. Another way to reduce the amount of salt you eat is to choose your condiments carefully. Many condiments are available in reduced-sodium versions, and salt substitutes can add flavor to your
                        food with less sodium.</p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4> Plan ahead: Create daily menus</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p> You know what foods to feature in your heart-healthy diet and which ones to limit. Now it's time to put your plans into action. Create daily menus using the six strategies listed above. When selecting foods for each meal and snack,
                        emphasize vegetables, fruits and whole grains. Choose lean protein sources and healthy fats, and limit salty foods. Watch your portion sizes and add variety to your menu choices. For example, if you have grilled salmon one evening,
                        try a black bean burger the next night. This helps ensure that you'll get all of the nutrients your body needs. Variety also makes your meals and snacks more interesting.</p>
                    <div class="hSymptoms">
                        <h4>Allow yourself an occasional treat</h4>
                    </div>
                    <p> Allow yourself an indulgence every now and then. A candy bar or handful of potato chips won't derail your heart-healthy diet. But don't let it turn into an excuse for giving up on your healthy-eating plan. If overindulgence is the
                        exception, rather than the rule, you'll balance things out over the long term. What's important is that you eat healthy foods most of the time. Incorporate these eight tips into your life, and you'll find that heart-healthy eating
                        is both doable and enjoyable. With planning and a few simple substitutions, you can eat with your heart in mind.</p>
